SALaunchShell is a simple NSObject Class that makes it easy to launch shell scripts using NSTask and launching shell scripts with authentication using STPrivilegedTask - an NSTask-like wrapper around AuthorizationExecuteWithPriviliges. This class provides the output from the shell script, and any error codes that might occur, back as a string. This class is very simple and only provides the most basic of functionality to run shell scripts from your application.  

Please feel free to customize the class as much as you'd like, or use any of the code within your projects.
